# Upwork XML to Sheets and Back

## Work Description

XML to Sheets and Back
Scripting & Automation Posted Nov 3, 2022
I have an XML file which is automatically generated from a software I use (ASCUDA) I can convert the XML into excel or google sheets to edit the data but then I am unable to convert the google sheet or Excel file back into XML format after editing.

What I would like is a google sheets (or if that is not possible) Excel file where I can cut and paste data into cells and then "save as" XML in a way that the saved XML format matches the original XML format.

## Usage

1. Create a new blank Google Spreadsheet [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/?tgif=d]
2. Go to Extensions -> App Scripts
3. Copy all the files to the new project
4. Click on RUN
5. Back to the spreadsheet click on the new menu > Export to XML...
